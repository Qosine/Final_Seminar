# README_Seminar_Group4_Nielsen

This is the README provided for the code used with the Seminar simulations

Included are the files; 
- simulation_support_functions.R
- simulation_script.R

The first one contains functions that will be called in the latter; these should be run first.
For the latter, the local pathing should be defined before running.
